# D-PDDM
## Requirements
The code is tested on Python 3.9. Please install requirements using:

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

To run the Bayesian neural network implementation:

``python dpddm_bayes.py``

For the full-information implementation of D-PDDM using training data, the code is currently being anonymized and cleaned. The repo will be updated shortly.

For the implementation of D-PDDM on CIFAR10 using CIFAR10.1 as the deployment distribution, the code is cuurrently being cleaned. The repo will be updated shortly. 

Thank you for your patience!

Details are in the revised version of the supplementary section.
